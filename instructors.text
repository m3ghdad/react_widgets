Make a Tabs component. Root should pass the Tabs component an array of Javascript objects that each have title and content as keys.
Keep track of the selected tab's index in your Tabs component's state. Set it initially to zero.
In the render method of Tabs, render a collection of <h1>s (with titles) in a <ul> and the content of the selected tab in an <article>.
Consider creating a Header subcomponent for the tabs.
Add a click handler to each header that updates the selected index in the Tabs component.
Remember that JSX interpolation is just syntactic sugar for passing an argument to a function, which means that it only supports expressions, so you can't use if/else inside { }. (This is also why you can't end with a semicolon.)
